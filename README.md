# WebAPIs for ITI

This project is a collection of labs and assignments related to WebAPIs developed as part of the curriculum at the Information Technology Institute.

## CarsController Endpoints

The `master` branch contains the first task of the WebAPIs lab, which is focused on the creation of endpoints for a `CarsController`. The endpoints are used to perform CRUD operations on a static list of cars, and also include custom validation and filtering.

## Reservation System

The `lab2` branch contains a reservation system project developed using the n-tier architecture. This project is aimed at demonstrating the use of WebAPIs for building a reservation system that allows users to reserve different types of tickets.

## Authentication and Authorization

The `lab3` branch is focused on developing a project related to authentication and authorization. Specifically, it involves creating a login and signup system that allows users to authenticate and access protected resources.
